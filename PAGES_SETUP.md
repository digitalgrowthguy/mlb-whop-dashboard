# 🔧 GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## ✅ YAML Syntax Issues Fixed

The workflow was failing because of incorrect YAML indentation. Fixed:
- Line 19: `steps:` was not properly indented under the job
- Line 48: Missing dash for the step name

## 🚀 NEW: Proper GitHub Pages Workflow

Created `deploy-pages.yml` which follows GitHub's recommended approach:
- Uses official GitHub Actions for Pages deployment
- Handles permissions automatically
- More reliable than manual git push approach

## 📋 Required GitHub Pages Settings

### **Step 1: Change GitHub Pages Source**
Based on the documentation you shared, you need to update your Pages settings:

1. **Go to your repository:** https://github.com/digitalgrowthguy/mlb-whop-dashboard
2. **Click Settings** (top menu)
3. **Click Pages** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")
4. **Under "Build and deployment", under "Source":**
   - Change from "Deploy from a branch" 
   - **Select "GitHub Actions"** ✅

### **Step 2: Test the New Workflow**
1. Go to **Actions tab** in your repository
2. Find "Deploy MLB Dashboard to GitHub Pages"
3. Click **"Run workflow"** to test it manually
4. Should complete successfully in 2-3 minutes

## 🎯 How This Fixes Your Issues

### **Before (Problems):**
- ❌ YAML syntax errors prevented workflow from running
- ❌ Permission issues with git push
- ❌ Manual branch deployment was unreliable

### **After (Solutions):**
- ✅ Clean YAML syntax - no more errors
- ✅ Uses GitHub's official Pages deployment action
- ✅ Automatic permission handling
- ✅ More reliable deployment process

## 🔄 Expected Workflow Behavior

### **Triggers:**
- **Daily at 6 AM EST** - Automatic updates
- **On every push to main** - Immediate updates when you make changes
- **Manual trigger** - You can run it anytime from Actions tab

### **Process:**
1. **Build Job:**
   - Fetches fresh MLB data
   - Generates dashboard
   - Uploads files as Pages artifact

2. **Deploy Job:**
   - Automatically deploys to GitHub Pages
   - Updates your live website
   - Shows deployment URL in Actions log

## 🌐 Your Dashboard URLs

After the workflow runs successfully:
- **Main URL:** https://digitalgrowthguy.github.io/mlb-whop-dashboard/
- **Direct to dashboard:** https://digitalgrowthguy.github.io/mlb-whop-dashboard/docs/

## 🧪 Troubleshooting Steps

### **If workflow still fails:**
1. Check that you changed Pages source to "GitHub Actions"
2. Look at the Actions tab for detailed error logs
3. Ensure all YAML files are valid (should be fixed now)

### **If Pages doesn't update:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes after workflow completion
2. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check the Pages settings are correct

### **If you see deployment errors:**
1. Go to repository Settings → Actions → General
2. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
3. Save and re-run the workflow

## 🎉 What You'll Get

Once set up correctly:
- ✅ **Automatic daily updates** at 6 AM EST
- ✅ **Real MLB data** with current games and predictions  
- ✅ **Professional dashboard** with A-F confidence grading
