# üöÄ GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Steps ‚úÖ

### 1. Repository Setup
- [ ] Repository created on GitHub
- [ ] Code pushed to `main` branch
- [ ] `.github/workflows/update-predictions.yml` in place
- [ ] `.gitignore` configured properly

### 2. Dependencies & Environment
- [ ] `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies

4. Under **Source**, select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Set **Branch** to `main`
6. Set **Folder** to `/docs`
7. Click **Save**

### 5. Verify Deployment
- [ ] GitHub Actions tab shows workflow runs
- [ ] `docs/` folder contains `index.html` and `data.json`
- [ ] Site accessible at `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name`
- [ ] Dashboard loads and displays predictions

## Daily Automation ‚è∞

### 6. GitHub Actions Workflow
- [ ] Workflow file in `.github/workflows/update-predictions.yml`
- [ ] Cron schedule set to `'0 11 * * *'` (6 AM EST)
- [ ] Workflow has write permissions to repository
- [ ] Manual trigger works (`workflow_dispatch`)

### 7. Test Automation
- [ ] Run workflow manually to test
- [ ] Check if site updates after workflow runs
- [ ] Verify predictions refresh daily
- [ ] Monitor for any failed runs

## Final Verification üéØ

### 8. Dashboard Features
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Today's games displayed correctly
- [ ] Confidence scoring visible
- [ ] YRFI/NRFI predictions balanced
- [ ] Last updated timestamp shown

### 9. Performance
- [ ] Page loads quickly (< 3 seconds)
- [ ] Works on mobile devices
- [ ] Auto-refresh during game hours
- [ ] JSON data feeds accessible

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è

### Common Issues:
1. **404 Error**: Check Pages settings, ensure `/docs` folder exists
2. **Workflow Fails**: Check Actions tab for error logs
3. **No Data**: Verify MLB API is accessible
4. **Predictions Don't Update**: Check workflow schedule and permissions

### Quick Commands:
```bash
# Test locally
python generate_static_site.py
python fetch_mlb_data.py

# Force workflow run
# Go to Actions tab ‚Üí "Daily MLB Predictions Update" ‚Üí "Run workflow"
```

## Success Metrics üìà
