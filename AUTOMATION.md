# 🤖 GitHub Actions Automation Guide

## Overview
Your MLB dashboard now has **3 automated workflows** that handle everything automatically:

## 🕕 Daily Updates Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/update-predictions.yml`  
**Trigger:** Every day at 6:00 AM EST (11:00 UTC)  
**What it does:**
- Fetches fresh MLB data for today's games
- Generates new predictions and dashboard
- Commits and pushes changes to GitHub
- Automatically deploys to GitHub Pages

## 📺 Live Game Updates Workflow  
**File:** `.github/workflows/live-updates.yml`  
**Trigger:** Every 30 minutes during game hours (1 PM - 11 PM EST)  
**What it does:**
- Checks for game status updates (scores, postponements, etc.)
- Updates dashboard only if games changed
- Provides real-time information during game days

## 🧪 Testing & Validation Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/test.yml`  
**Trigger:** On every push/pull request + manual trigger  
**What it does:**
- Tests MLB API connection
- Validates predictor functionality
- Ensures dashboard generation works
- Prevents broken deployments

## 🎯 How It All Works Together

### **Morning (6 AM EST)**
1. Daily workflow fetches today's games
2. Generates fresh predictions
3. Updates your live dashboard
4. Testing workflow validates everything works

### **During Game Hours (1-11 PM EST)**  
1. Live updates check for game changes every 30 minutes
2. Dashboard refreshes if scores/statuses change
3. Users always see current information

### **Continuous**
- Every code change is automatically tested
- GitHub Pages auto-deploys from the `docs/` folder
- No manual intervention needed

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

### ✅ Already Configured:
- [x] Repository with GitHub Actions enabled
- [x] GitHub Pages enabled (Deploy from branch: main/docs)
- [x] Workflow permissions set correctly
- [x] Scripts are PowerShell compatible

### 🎛️ Manual Triggers Available:
Go to your GitHub repo → Actions tab → Select any workflow → "Run workflow"

## 📊 Monitoring Your Automation

### Check Workflow Status:
1. Go to `https://github.com/digitalgrowthguy/mlb-whop-dashboard/actions`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Daily Updates Fail:
1. Check Actions tab for error logs
2. Manually run: `Update-Dashboard` in PowerShell
3. Check if MLB API is accessible

### If Live Updates Stop:
1. Verify game schedule (no updates on off-days)
2. Check workflow permissions in repo settings
3. Manually trigger the live-updates workflow

### If Dashboard Doesn't Update:
1. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled
2. Check that commits are being pushed to main
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages deployment
